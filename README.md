tibpri will be an app to get Tibber price data on your wrist (assuming you're wearing a Wear OS watch). It uses [Tibber's API](https://developer.tibber.com/docs/overview) to get the data.

## Development

A personal access token from Tibber is required, add it to your global `gradle.properties` like this:

```
tibberAccessToken=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
```
